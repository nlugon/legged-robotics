## 1. Bipedal Locomotion (`biped-robot/`)

### Overview
This project focuses on planning the Center of Mass (CoM) trajectory for a bipedal robot using the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) framework. The implementation addresses dynamic balancing and stable walking on flat terrain.

### Key Features
- **DCM Planning**: Trajectory generation for CoM based on the DCM model.
- **Foot Trajectory Planning**: Fixed-step positions for dynamic balance.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Mapping desired trajectories to joint space.

## 2. Quadrupedal Locomotion (`quadruped-robot/`)

### Overview
This project implements locomotion controllers for quadrupedal robots using:
1. Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) for various gaits (walk, trot, pace, bound).
2. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for adaptive locomotion across challenging terrains.

### Key Features
#### Central Pattern Generators (CPG)
- Coupled oscillators for gait generation.
- Cartesian and joint PD control for foot placement.

#### Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
- Markov Decision Process (MDP) design for observation, action, and reward spaces.
- Implementation of PPO and SAC algorithms for policy learning.
